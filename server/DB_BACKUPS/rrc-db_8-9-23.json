I grew up showjumping (started riding horses at age 4 and by 5yo I was competing) and was recruited to ride for Fresno State on their NCAA D1 Equestrian team and given a scholarship! I graduated shortly before covid started so come 2020, I knew moving to a new state and getting hired was going to be difficult so I worked at a barn in Colorado as their head groom/ manager. I cared and rode horses valued up to $500,000 and in 2022 I had a career change and started interning at R&R and was then hired full time!",

It was a really interesting time to be in Russia - Pussy Riot had just been arrested, Edward Snowden had just landed, there were rumors of war. I ended up leaving very suddenly when RU annexed Crimea in 2015 - it was certainly one way to spend your early twenties!",
