Users can opt in and out of 'RR Connect' using a form. 

Twice a month, each user will be paired with another random user and connected via email. 

A user will not be paired with the same person twice, unless they have first been paired with everybody. 

A volunteer 'fallback user' will be paired with any odd person out.
